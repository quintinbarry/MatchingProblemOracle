# MatchingProblemOracle

In this project I created an Oralce for the perfect matching problem. My code takes a possible solution to a perfect matching problem and asserts whether it is correct or not. 

This Oracle is for the instance of the matching problem where a perfect match is made iff no company/canadate would rather be matched to someone else (A) and A would rather be matched with said company/canadate than their current matching.
